# Fly

A small static website with multiple pages.

## Development

Open `index.html` directly or serve the site locally:

```bash
python3 -m http.server -b 0.0.0.0 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. Use the navigation links to switch between the home page and the about page.
